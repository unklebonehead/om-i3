# om-i3
configs for om i3 spin
OpenMandriva Packages required:
- i3-gaps
- polybar
- feh
- kitty
- micro
- ranger
- dunst
- om-wallpapers-extra-twm
- pcmanfm-qt
- rofi
- conky

It's your choice of screenshot tool. I personally use flameshot. Config is set up for mate screenshot tool.
Place contents of .config in ~/.config and contents of .local in ~/.local. Kitty and Micro have been themed with OpenMandriva colors.


Config also contains my xrandr command for my triple monitors. You will need to modify the xrandr command for your personal set up. 

Make sure any rofi scripts, polybar's launch.sh are executable.
