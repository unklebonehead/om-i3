# om-i3
configs for om i3 spin
OpenMandriva Packages required:
- i3-gaps
- polybar
- feh
- kitty
- micro
- ranger
- dunst
- om-wallpapers-extra-twm

It's your choice of screenshot tool. I personally use flameshot. Config is set up for mate screenshot tool.
Place contents of .config in ~/.config and contents of .local in ~/.local. Kitty and Micro have been themed with OpenMandriva colors.
